						Photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes capture sunlight and subsequently transfer the associated 
						energy as electronic excitations to reaction centres where charge separation and charge transfer takes 
						place. Experimental studies suggest that this energy transfer process is not always fully described by 
						classical probability laws but instead can involve quantum-coherent evolution of electronic excitations. 
						There is also evidence that suggests the possibility of coherent dynamics in the charge transfer step 
						following energy transfer. Our group is interested in understanding the basic transfer mechanisms 
						and implications of coherence during these primary steps in photosynthesis.  To this aim we develop and 
						apply theoretical frameworks to describe the processes of energy and charge transfer beyond the incoherent 
						transfer limits of F&ouml;rster (energy transfer) or Marcus (charge transfer) theories. In particular, we follow
						 the approach of open quantum system, where the quantum system of interest is usually the electronic degrees
						  of freedom (and possibly a few vibrational modes) and the bath represents all other degrees of freedom, 
						  mainly vibrations due to the protein and solvent environment of bio-molecules. Within this 
						  theoretical approach, we focus on investigating <a href="#non-classical-vibs-section">non-classical features of vibrational and electronic 
						  dynamics in biomolecules</a> and their relation to the photosynthetic function.

							This strand of research is focused on the possible ability of bio-molecules to exhibit and potentially utilize,
							non-classical phenomena to aid their performance. The presence of long-lived electronic (excitonic)
							coherences has been proposed as mechanism to improve the efficiency of excitation energy transfer in
							light harvesting systems. Our research aims to establish the possible relationship between functionality
							and the presence of quantum mechanical coherences. In this direction we are interested in answering
							several related questions. Among these, is what is the relevance of coherent dynamics under in vivo
							conditions of illumination (sunlight) as opposed to laboratory excitation conditions? We are also
							investigating how quantum features of energy transfer may alter as the spectroscopic properties of
							light-harvesting complexes acclimate to different light-illumination conditions. We are also studying
							the fundamental role that quantized vibrations strongly coupled to electronic degrees of freedom,
							typical of many biomolecules, play in determining their electronic dynamics. Broadening the
							investigation of non-classicality beyond the electronic degrees of freedom to include these
							vibrations may aid in establishing a relation between non-classicality and its functional role.

							The counting statistics of exciton and charge transfer can reveal detailed information
							about the underlying processes in a system. It can even give us information about whether
							quantum mechanical effects such as coherence are affecting the transport. This technique can 
							be applied to energy transfer in light-harvesting antennae and charge separation in 
							the photosynthetic reaction centre in order to unveil how these systems utilise quantum effects
							and whether they increase the efficiency of the transport processes. We are interested in 
							developing experimental proposals that use counting statistics to unveil quantum features in transport
							dynamics without the interference of ultra-fast laser pulses, for example by studying the current 
							through a reaction centre.
